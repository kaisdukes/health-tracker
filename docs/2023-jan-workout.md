# Jan 2023 4-day Split

## Motivation

It's a new year and time for me to adjust my training routine. I'm currently doing push-ups every morning on training days (3 sets of 20) and following a 4-day pull, push, legs, rest cycle that equates to slightly over 5 days a week weightlifting on average. This is on top of 10k steps every day including rest days.

I feel like I'm overtraining. I'm going to try to switch to a 4-day a week split instead of 5 days to get an extra rest day and I'm also going to stop the morning push-ups to avoid overtraining chest and to get more recovery.

## Workout design

The main muscle groups I really want to focus are on chest, arms and abs, as I feel these are currently underdeveloped. However, I still want to do everything else in those 4 days. I started by picking the chest focus 4-day split suggestion from [this guide](https://www.muscleandstrength.com/articles/the-ultimate-muscle-building-split-reference-guide.html), which was split out as chest/triceps/abs, legs, chest/shoulders/abs, back/biceps.

I kept revising this until I got the balance I wanted and in the end the final workout didn't really resemble the starting point. But it was good to have something to work with other than a blank piece of paper. By the end of the all the revisions, I ended up with chest/shoulders/triceps/abs, back/biceps, chest/shoulders/abs, legs/arms. My legs are pretty strong from 10k steps a day and plus my muscle growth tends to be lower body focused as opposed to upper body, given my genetics. I'm still going to do squats and leg press once a week, but less of the other leg isolation exercises so I can focus more on arms.

| Day       | Muscle groups                      |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Monday    | Chest, shoulders, triceps and  abs |
| Tuesday   | Back and biceps                    |
| Wednesday |                                    |
| Thursday  | Chest, shoulders and abs           |
| Friday    | Legs and arms                      |
| Saturday  |                                    |
| Sunday    |                                    |

## Differences from my current routine

So what's different from what I'm currently doing? Two main differences. Firstly, more rest days. I'm getting three days a week rest in the new plan instead of only two days rest. Secondly, I'm going to start doing core exercises (ab workouts) and more variety on shoulders. Sure, my current 22% body fat is covering my abs right now with a fat stomach, but I still want to start abs work right now so when I finally burn that fat, I have some abs to show underneath. Plus the new plan still does chest and pull-ups twice a week, which is great news.

## How many sets per muscle group?

To work out how many sets, I'd like to follow some research by [Dr Mike Israetel](https://rpstrength.com/team-member/mike-israetel-phd), who has a PhD and is also a bodybuilder. However, because I only have 4 days and want to train for not much over an hour each time, I have to limit sets. My current routine is around 26 sets per workout, aiming for around 90 seconds to 2 minutes between rest between sets, so let's stick with that.

## Workout plan

Now I've got a number of sets to work with (26 sets per day), I can break this down into exercises.

## Volume and sets per muscle group

Let's see how our sets per week compare against [these volume guidelines](https://outlift.com/hypertrophy-training-volume) from Dr Mike Israetel.

| Muscle group    | Sets per week | Guideline          | Guideline midpoint |
| --------------- | ------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| Chest           | 20            | 10-22              | 16                 |
| Upper back      | 17            | 10-25              | 18                 |
| Triceps         | 16            | 6-30               | 18                 |
| Abs             | 13            | 0-25               | 13                 |
| Biceps          | 12            | 8-26               | 17                 |
| Shoulders       | 11            | 8-26               | 17                 |
| Quads           | 11            | 8-20               | 14                 |
| Hamstrings      | 11            | 6-20               | 13                 |
| Calves          | 11            | 8-16               | 12                 |

Looking good! We're in the guideline range for all muscle groups. It's hard to hit the midpoint for all muscle groups as this only a 4-day split and not a 5-day routine. However, we're pretty close in most cases. Shoulders and biceps could be better, but we only have a limited number of total sets per week and the focus was more on chest and triceps by design, so this is expected.

I'll try this workout for a while and see how it goes. Will be interesting to compare this to the 5-day split I'm currently doing. Hopefully, the extra rest will be worth it.
