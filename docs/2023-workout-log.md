# January 2023

## Goals and recent stats

My current goal is to diet while weightlifting until I reach 12% body fat, ideally without losing any muscle mass. After that, I want to start bulking and cutting cycles until I reach my long term life goal of 78 kg at 12% body fat.

After years on/off at the gym, I restarted seriously again on August 28th, 2022 (4 months ago). For the first three months (September, October and November) I ate pretty much at maintenance levels (or slightly over) and went up from 82 kg to 84 kg, although that was probably largely increased water retention. I felt a bit stronger though after those initial three months.

By December 2022 not much had changed, and I was at 25% body fat at 84 kg at the start of the month. I decided to start cutting by reducing calories by 600 kcal/day. After a month (end of December 2022), I reached 80 kg at 22% body fat, so a mix of water and fat loss. Assuming I don't lose any further lean mass, I need to keep dieting until I hit around 70 kg to achieve 12% body fat. Another 10 kilos to go. That would give me a lean mass of around 62 kg. To bulk back up to 78 kg and keep at 12% body fat, I'd need to gain around 7 kg of lean mass.

Is this realistic?

In a lifetime and without using steroids, the natural limit for most men who lift weights consistently and train hard is to gain a maximum of 15-20 kg. So, 7 kg sounds like it's doable, assuming I've already gained over half of my max potential and it's not too late given my age. Not sure how long it's going to take given I'm heading into my mid 40s, but if there was one last chance to do it before I get too old, it's probably now.

I'm 100% motivated. I've so far completed 4 months of weightlifting and the last 4 weeks of that has been dieting. I'm really looking forward to hitting 12% body fat. After that I'll start alternating between bulking and cutting to grow muscle but to keep the body fat within an acceptable percentage.

Wish me luck! This is probably a 3-5 year journeyâ€¦

## Motivation for changing routine for January 2023

It's a new year and time for me to adjust my training routine. I'm currently doing push-ups every morning on training days (3 sets of 20) and following a 4-day pull, push, legs, rest cycle that equates to slightly over 5 days a week weightlifting on average. This is on top of 10k steps every day including rest days.

I feel like I'm overtraining. I'm going to try to switch to a 4-day a week split instead of 5 days to get an extra rest day and I'm also going to stop the morning push-ups to avoid overtraining chest and to get more recovery.

## Workout priorities and design

The main muscle groups I really want to focus on are chest, arms and abs, as I feel these are currently underdeveloped. However, I still want to do everything else in those 4 days. I started by picking the chest focus 4-day split suggestion from [this guide](https://www.muscleandstrength.com/articles/the-ultimate-muscle-building-split-reference-guide.html), which was split out as chest/triceps/abs, legs, chest/shoulders/abs, back/biceps.

I kept revising this until I got the balance I wanted and in the end the final workout didn't really resemble the starting point. But it was good to have something to work with other than a blank piece of paper. By the end of all the revisions, I ended up with chest/shoulders/triceps/abs, back/biceps, chest/shoulders/abs, legs/arms. My legs are pretty strong from 10k steps a day and plus my muscle growth tends to be lower body focused as opposed to upper body, given my genetics. I'm still going to do squats and leg press once a week, but less of the other leg isolation exercises so I can focus more on arms.

| Day       | Muscle groups                      |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Day 1     | Chest, shoulders, triceps and  abs |
| Day 2     | Back and biceps                    |
| Day 3     |                                    |
| Day 4     | Chest, shoulders and abs           |
| Day 5     |                                    |
| Day 6     | Legs and arms                      |
| Day 7     |                                    |

## Differences from my current routine

So what's different from what I'm currently doing? Two main differences. Firstly, more rest days. I'm getting three days a week rest in the new plan instead of only two days rest. Secondly, I'm going to start doing core exercises (ab workouts) and more variety on shoulders. Sure, my current 22% body fat is covering my abs right now with a fat stomach, but I still want to start abs work right now so when I finally burn that fat, I have some abs to show underneath. Plus the new plan still does chest and pull-ups twice a week, which is great news.

## How many sets per muscle group?

To work out how many sets, I'd like to follow some research by [Dr Mike Israetel](https://rpstrength.com/team-member/mike-israetel-phd), who has a PhD and is also a bodybuilder. However, because I only have 4 days and want to train for not much over an hour each time, I have to limit sets. My current routine is around 26 sets per workout, aiming for around 90 seconds to 2 minutes rest between sets, so let's stick with that for now.

## January 2023 workout plan

Now I've got a number of sets to work with (26 sets per day), I can break this down into exercises.

## Volume and sets per muscle group

Let's see how our sets per week compare against [these volume guidelines](https://outlift.com/hypertrophy-training-volume) from Dr Mike Israetel.

| Muscle group    | Sets per week | Guideline          | Guideline midpoint |
| --------------- | ------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| Chest           | 20            | 10-22              | 16                 |
| Triceps         | 16            | 6-30               | 18                 |
| Upper back      | 15            | 10-25              | 18                 |
| Biceps          | 14            | 8-26               | 17                 |
| Shoulders       | 14            | 8-26               | 17                 |
| Quads           | 11            | 8-20               | 14                 |
| Hamstrings      | 11            | 6-20               | 13                 |
| Calves          | 11            | 8-16               | 12                 |
| Abs             | 10            | 0-25               | 13                 |

Looking good! We're in the guideline range for all muscle groups. It's hard to hit the midpoint for all muscle groups as this only a 4-day split and not a 5-day routine. However, we're pretty close in most cases.

I'll try this workout for a while and see how it goes. Will be interesting to compare this to the 5-day split I'm currently doing. Hopefully, the extra rest will be worth it.

## January 9th, 2023

I've completed the first week on the new 4-day split today, and after much thinking, weighing up the risks and discussion with friends, I've also decided to start on natural testosterone and anabolic boosters for a 4-month trial period. I'm going to get blood work done before and after the trial period in case of any liver issues.

The 4-day split feels really good. I'm loving the extra rest days compared to pull/push/legs/rest cycles I was doing previously, and I'm also happy I'm still doing chest and pull-ups twice a week. Also did abs for the first time in years and was happy that my abs actually got sore. The [hanging leg raises](reports/exercises/hanging-leg-raise.md) are a killer exercise! Will definitely be continuing with the 4-day split for a while, likely all the way through the long cut, down to 12% body fat. The split feels well thought out and I'm loving it. Have been getting a brief, but awesome post-workout natural high.

Today I made a purchase from [Predator Nutrition](https://www.predatornutrition.com) for three products (ingredients below). Are these going to actually work? I'm not sure. I'm already eating a well thought out and balanced diet while on a cut, sleeping well, taking whey protein, creatine, BCAA, multivitamins, HMB, omega-3 and B12. I feel I may be starting to get into the area of diminishing returns with further supplements.

However, the three products by [Competitive Edge Labs](https://competitiveedgelabs.com) looked like they were well researched. They're mostly natural herb extracts for boosting testosterone and promoting muscle growth. I spent time going through each and every ingredient, and most of them appeared to have scientific studies showing either modest or significant effects. I'm not expecting miracles as these are not steroids, but at my age I'll take whatever works.

I'm going to try a 4-month course. The testosterone booster needs to be cycled to avoid tolerance (6 weeks on / 4 weeks off), but the anabolic boosters should be fine to take continuously over that period.

Some downsides:

1. These boosters have some risk
2. They need to be cycled on/off
3. You can't take them all the time

To stay safe, after the 4-month cycle I'm going to get blood tests done to see if there are any liver issues.

### Fadogia Agrestis

No human studies to show that this boosts testosterone in males (source: [WebMD](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-1162/fadogia-agrestis)), however anecdotal evidence from bodybuilders is that this is a significant testosterone booster. Scientific studies on rats have shown strong results (source: [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16281088)).

### Urtica Dioica

Rat studies have shown this improves free testosterone levels (source: [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21806658)). It's not clear if these results translate to humans.

### Ashwagandha

Human studies have shown modest increases in testosterone (source: [Examine](https://examine.com/articles/does-ashwagandha-increase-testosterone)).

### Eurycoma Longifolia

Multiple scientific studies on humans have shown significant increases in muscle strength and testosterone levels (source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurycoma_longifolia)).

### Shilajit

Human studies have shown significant testosterone increases at 500mg per day (source: [Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/health/shilajit)). Note that I'll be taking Shilajit both from CEL M-Test and from CEL Anabolic Effect, for a total dosage of 450mg daily.

### Boron Citrate

Proven to increase the metabolism of total testosterone to free testosterone (source: [Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/health/boron-testosterone)).

### Mucuna Pruriens

Shown to promote modest increases in testosterone in human studies (source: [Examine](https://examine.com/supplements/mucuna-pruriens/research)).

### Viscum Album

Shown to promote hypertrophy in mice (source: [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28109285)).

### Eriobotrya Japonica

Prevents muscle degredation in rats (source: [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26004741)), so may be useful to avoid muscle loss in humans while cutting.

### Rehmannia

Not clear if this is an anabolic booster (source: [WebMD](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-1155/rehmannia)).

### ActiGin

Shown to support endurance in multiple studies.

### S7

A combination of coffee, green tea, turmeric, tart cherry, blueberry, broccoli and kale, that may boost gym pumps.

### AstraGin

Helps with absorption of the other ingredients in the anabolic booster. Backed by multiple scientific studies.

### Epicatechin

May cause moderate strength increases according to scientific studies (source: [Examine](https://examine.com/articles/does-dark-chocolates-epicatechin-content-promote-muscle-growth)). However, more likely to boost endurance and gym pump according to anecdotal evidence from bodybuilders.

## January 10th, 2023

Just got my blood work results back before I start on the boosters. I also had a blood test 4 months ago at the start of September 2022, around the same time I started properly weight training again. Initial testosterone levels in early September were 17.2 nmol/L. With the blood test just in, I'm at 21.5 nmol/L (with 0.363 nmol/L free testosterone). Normal ranges for men over 40 are between roughly 12 and 31 nmol/L.

The summary is my testosterone levels are completely normal and if anything are almost exactly in the middle of the expected range. They've increased slightly (from around 17 to 22 nmol/L) over the last 4 months since I switched over to a much more healthy lifestyle with good diet and exercise.

Will be interesting to compare this to the next blood test in around 4 months after the trial course of boosters. Hopefully healthy levels of increased testosterone and no liver issues.

# Feburary 2023

## Weight progression

I've completed 4 weeks on the 4-day a week split, having dropped the number of days slightly from 5 days a week previously, as I felt I was overtraining while dieting. Weight training on a calorie deficit is hard. Especially when you are trying to lift heavy and continue with progressive overload. However, strength training essential if you want to retain as much lean mass as possible while cutting.

Advantages of the January 4-day routine:

* It's chest, shoulders and arms focused, so I'm developing the muscles I wanted to in the first place.
* It feels well thought and balanced. I feel that each week I'm exercises every major muscle group to some extent.
* My legs still feel strong and in good shape in proportion to other muscle groups, even though I've reduced legs to only squats and leg press once a week. This could also be because I'm consistently walking over 10k steps a day at a brisk pace.

Disadvantages:

* My back isn't developing as much as I would have liked, although given I'm only working out 4 days a week it's almost impossible to hit every major muscle group as much as I would like to.
* Hanging knee raises were too easy and felt like a waste of sets. I could be doing something else with that gym time.

New routine for February is listed below. This is essentially the same as the January routine, but with a few changes:

* Increased weight on arms exercises and legs.
* Increased weight on back exercises, except for pull downs.
* Increased weight on flat chest press, but not on incline chest press.
* More reps for pull-ups and hanging leg raises.
* I've replaced hanging knee raises with 1-minue planks. The plan is to build up to 2-minute planks by increasing 30 seconds each month.
* For the exercises I'm not increasing through weight, I can still get progressive improvements by increasing reps while focusing on form, until I'm comfortably in the 8-12 rep range.

I'm excited about February's training plan for one big reason. I'm finally going to try to flat bench press using the 30 kg a side dumbbells. A major achievement, if I can progress to this level while dieting.

### Day 1: Chest, shoulders, triceps and abs (26 sets)
