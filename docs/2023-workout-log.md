# January 2023

## Goals and recent stats

My current goal is to diet while weightlifting until I reach 12% body fat, ideally without losing any muscle mass. After that, I want to start bulking and cutting cycles until I reach my long term life goal of 78 kg at 12% body fat.

After years on/off at the gym, I restarted seriously again at on August 28th, 2022 (4 months ago). For the first three months (September, October and November) I ate pretty much at maintenance levels (or slightly over) and went up from 82 kg to 84 kg, although that was probably largely increased water retention. I felt a bit stronger though after those initial three months.

By December 2022 not much had changed, and I was at 25% body fat at 84 kg at the start of the month. I decided to start cutting by reducing calories by 600 kcal/day. After a month (end of December 2022), I reached 80 kg at 22% body fat, so a mix of water and fat loss. Assuming I don't lose any further lean mass, I need to keep dieting until I hit around 70 kg to achieve 12% body fat. Another 10 kilos to go. That would give me a lean mass of around 62 kg. To bulk back up to 78 kg and keep at 12% body fat, I'd need to gain around 7 kg of lean mass.

Is this realistic?

In a lifetime and without using steroids, the natural limit for most men who lift weights consistently and train hard is to gain a maximum of 15-20 kg. So, 7 kg sounds like it's doable, assuming I've already gained over half of my max potential and it's not too late given my age. Not sure how long it's going to take given I'm heading into my mid 40s, but if there was one last chance to do it before I get too old, it's probably now.

I'm 100% motivated. I've so far completed 4 months of weightlifting and the last 4 weeks of that has been dieting. I'm really looking forward to hitting 12% body fat. After that I'll start alternating between bulking and cutting to grow muscle but to keep the body fat within an acceptable percentage.

Wish me luck! This is probably a 3-5 year journeyâ€¦

## Motivation for changing routine for January 2023

It's a new year and time for me to adjust my training routine. I'm currently doing push-ups every morning on training days (3 sets of 20) and following a 4-day pull, push, legs, rest cycle that equates to slightly over 5 days a week weightlifting on average. This is on top of 10k steps every day including rest days.

I feel like I'm overtraining. I'm going to try to switch to a 4-day a week split instead of 5 days to get an extra rest day and I'm also going to stop the morning push-ups to avoid overtraining chest and to get more recovery.

## Workout priorities and design

The main muscle groups I really want to focus on are chest, arms and abs, as I feel these are currently underdeveloped. However, I still want to do everything else in those 4 days. I started by picking the chest focus 4-day split suggestion from [this guide](https://www.muscleandstrength.com/articles/the-ultimate-muscle-building-split-reference-guide.html), which was split out as chest/triceps/abs, legs, chest/shoulders/abs, back/biceps.

I kept revising this until I got the balance I wanted and in the end the final workout didn't really resemble the starting point. But it was good to have something to work with other than a blank piece of paper. By the end of all the revisions, I ended up with chest/shoulders/triceps/abs, back/biceps, chest/shoulders/abs, legs/arms. My legs are pretty strong from 10k steps a day and plus my muscle growth tends to be lower body focused as opposed to upper body, given my genetics. I'm still going to do squats and leg press once a week, but less of the other leg isolation exercises so I can focus more on arms.

| Day       | Muscle groups                      |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Day 1     | Chest, shoulders, triceps and  abs |
| Day 2     | Back and biceps                    |
| Day 3     |                                    |
| Day 4     | Chest, shoulders and abs           |
| Day 5     |                                    |
| Day 6     | Legs and arms                      |
| Day 7     |                                    |

## Differences from my current routine

So what's different from what I'm currently doing? Two main differences. Firstly, more rest days. I'm getting three days a week rest in the new plan instead of only two days rest. Secondly, I'm going to start doing core exercises (ab workouts) and more variety on shoulders. Sure, my current 22% body fat is covering my abs right now with a fat stomach, but I still want to start abs work right now so when I finally burn that fat, I have some abs to show underneath. Plus the new plan still does chest and pull-ups twice a week, which is great news.

## How many sets per muscle group?

To work out how many sets, I'd like to follow some research by [Dr Mike Israetel](https://rpstrength.com/team-member/mike-israetel-phd), who has a PhD and is also a bodybuilder. However, because I only have 4 days and want to train for not much over an hour each time, I have to limit sets. My current routine is around 26 sets per workout, aiming for around 90 seconds to 2 minutes rest between sets, so let's stick with that for now.

## Volume and sets per muscle group

Let's see how our sets per week compare against [these volume guidelines](https://outlift.com/hypertrophy-training-volume) from Dr Mike Israetel.

| Muscle group    | Sets per week | Guideline          | Guideline midpoint |
| --------------- | ------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| Chest           | 20            | 10-22              | 16                 |
| Triceps         | 16            | 6-30               | 18                 |
| Upper back      | 15            | 10-25              | 18                 |
| Biceps          | 14            | 8-26               | 17                 |
| Shoulders       | 14            | 8-26               | 17                 |
| Quads           | 11            | 8-20               | 14                 |
| Hamstrings      | 11            | 6-20               | 13                 |
| Calves          | 11            | 8-16               | 12                 |
| Abs             | 10            | 0-25               | 13                 |

Looking good! We're in the guideline range for all muscle groups. It's hard to hit the midpoint for all muscle groups as this only a 4-day split and not a 5-day routine. However, we're pretty close in most cases.

I'll try this workout for a while and see how it goes. Will be interesting to compare this to the 5-day split I'm currently doing. Hopefully, the extra rest will be worth it.
